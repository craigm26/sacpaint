"""OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible localhost endpoint backed by the Claude Code CLI.

Lets a tool that only speaks HTTP to an LLM API — ``inspect-robots
--policy agent``, for instance — run on the owner's Claude subscription
instead of a metered API key.

Results produced this way go through Claude Code's own harness and system
prompt, so they carry the ``claude-code-cli`` wire label and are not
comparable to raw-API runs. See ``docs/subscription.md``.
