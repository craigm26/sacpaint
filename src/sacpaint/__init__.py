"""Sacramento PaintBench: an Inspect Robots benchmark.

The task is one sentence: draw the fixed reference image on the canvas, using
the camera to inspect and correct, and stop when done. The built-in reference
is the original photograph of Sacramento (Tower Bridge above the Capitol dome,
joined by the Capitol Mall); any ``.spec.json`` of strokes, with or without a
photograph, makes another. Scoring is geometric, not aesthetic: each landmark
must be present, in the right place, in the right relation to the others.
