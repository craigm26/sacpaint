"""A small, loud client for the robot-md-gateway ``/v1/invoke`` endpoint.

Every motion this benchmark makes goes through the gateway, so every motion
leaves an Ed25519-signed receipt. That is the whole reason to prefer this body
over a direct serial driver, and it is why this module keeps the *entire*
response for every call rather than unwrapping it to a return value: the
receipt is the artifact, the telemetry is a detail of it.

Wire shape, from Bob's archived receipts and the receiver's ``InvokeEnvelope``:

* request — ``POST {gateway}/v1/invoke``, ``Authorization: Bearer <token>``,
  body ``{msg_id, type, ruri, scope, tool_name, tool_args, manifest_path,
  actuator_name?, nonce?, timestamp_ms?}``. The client sends no key id; it names
  the manifest by path and the gateway echoes back the ``manifest_kid`` it
  verified, which is what :class:`GatewayClient` asserts against.
* allow — ``200 {"ok": true, "manifest_kid", "telemetry": {...}, "outcome":
  {...}, "envelope_signature": {...}}``. Tool output is the top-level
  ``telemetry``; ``outcome`` carries only its hash.
* deny — ``403 {"detail": {"deny": "<code>", "reason": ..., "outcome": ...,
  "envelope_signature": ...}}``. A deny is a *signed promise that nothing
  moved*, and callers turn it into ``SafetyAbort``.
* fault — ``500 {"detail": {"actuator_error": ...}}``, unsigned, and motion
  state is unknown. That is an ``EmbodimentFault``, never a shrug.

The three defensive seams that matter, because the ``arm.move_to`` / ``arm.state``
tools are being written by someone else right now: tool names are configurable,
telemetry field names are looked up through alias lists, and an unrecognised
success body raises instead of returning zeros.
